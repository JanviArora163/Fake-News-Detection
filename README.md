# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Fake News Detection is a Machine Learning and NLP-based project that classifies news articles as Real or Fake. It uses text preprocessing, feature extraction, and supervised learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy and combat misinformation.

## 🚀 Features
- 🧹 Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)
- 📊 Feature extraction using NLP techniques
- 🤖 Machine Learning model training
- 📈 Model evaluation and accuracy analysis
- 🧪 Tested on real-world news datasets

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📚 Pandas & NumPy
- 🧠 Scikit-learn
- ✍️ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- 📊 Matplotlib / Seaborn
  
## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the news dataset
2. Convert text into numerical features
3. Train ML models on labeled data
4. Predict whether news is real or fake
5. Evaluate performance using accuracy metrics

## 📊 Output
- ✅ Real News
- ❌ Fake News

The model predicts the authenticity of news based on learned patterns from data.

## 🎯 Use Cases
- Social media content verification
- News platform moderation
- Academic research
- Awareness against misinformation
